(b) Each person who applies under part 21 for such a certificate or change must show compliance with the applicable requirements of this part. (c) An applicant is eligible for a propeller type certificate and changes to those certificates after demonstrating compliance with subparts A, B and C of this part. However, the propeller may not be installed on an airplane unless the applicant has shown compliance with either Sec 23.907 or Sec 25.907 of this chapter, as applicable, or compliance is not required for installation on that airplane. (d) For the purposes of this part, the propeller consists of those components listed in the propeller type design, and the propeller system consists of the propeller and all the components necessary for its functioning, but not necessarily included in the propeller type design. 35.2 Propeller Configuration The applicant must provide a list of all the components, including references to the relevant drawings and software design data, that define the type design of the propeller to be approved under CASR Part 21.31. 35.3 Instructions for Propeller Installation and Operation www.peraturan.go.id 2015, No.689 6 The applicant must provide instructions that are approved by the DGCA.

      "text": "Continued Airworthiness The applicant must prepare instructions for Continued Airworthiness in accordance with Appendix A to this attachment that are acceptable to the Director General. The instructions may be incomplete at type certification if a program exist to ensure their completion prior to delivery of the first aircraft with the propeller installed, or upon issuance of a standard certificate of airworthiness for an aircraft with the propeller installed, whichever occurs later. 35.5 Propeller Ratings and Operating Limitations (a) Propeller ratings and operating limitations must: (1) Be established by the applicant and approved by the Director General. (2) Be included directly or by reference in the propeller type certificate data sheet, as specified in CASR Part 21.41. (3) Be based on the operating conditions demonstrated during the tests required by this part as well as any other information the DGCA requires as necessary for the safe operation of the propeller. (b) Propeller ratings and operating limitations must be established for the following, as applicable: (1) Power and rotational speed: www.peraturan.go.id 2015, No.689 7 (i) For takeoff. (ii) For maximum continuous. (iii) If requested by the applicant, other ratings may also be established. (2) Overspeed and overtorque limits. 35.7 Features and Characteristics (a) The propeller may not have features or characteristics, revealed by any test or analysis or known to the applicant, that make it unsafe for the uses for which certification is requested. (b) If a failure occurs during a certification test, the applicant must determine the cause and assess the effect on the airworthiness of the propeller. The applicant must make changes to the design and conduct additional tests that the Director General finds necessary to establish the airworthiness of the propeller. SUBPART B – DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 35.11 RESERVED 35.13 RESERVED 35.15 Safety Analysis (a) (1) The applicant must analyze the propeller system to assess the likely consequences of all failures that can reasonably be expected to occur. This analysis will take into account, if applicable: (i) The propeller system in a typical installation. When the analysis depends on representative components, assumed interfaces, or assumed installed conditions, the assumptions must be stated in the analysis. (ii) Consequential secondary failures and dormant failures. (iii) Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, or that result in the hazardous propeller effects defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section. (2) The applicant must summarize those failures that could result in major propeller effects or hazardous propeller effects defined in paragraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of occurrence of those effects. www.peraturan.go.id 2015, No.689 8 (3) The applicant must show that hazardous propeller effects are not predicted to occur at a rate in excess of that defined as extremely remote (probability of 10−7 or less per propeller flight hour). Since the estimated probability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess the total rate for hazardous propeller effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous propeller effect arising",

In dealing with probabilities of this low order of magnitude, absolute proof is not possible and reliance must be placed on engineering judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies. (b) If significant doubt exists as to the effects of failures or likely combination of failures, the DGCA may require assumptions used in the analysis to be verified by test. (c) The primary failures of certain single propeller elements (for example, blades) cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the failure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous propeller effects, those elements must be identified as propeller critical parts. (d) For propeller critical parts, applicants must meet the prescribed integrity specifications of CASR Part 35 Section 35.16. These instances must be stated in the safety analysis. (e) If the safety analysis depends on one or more of the following items, those items must be identified in the analysis and appropriately substantiated. (1) Maintenance actions being carried out at stated intervals. This includes verifying that items that could fail in a latent manner are functioning properly. When necessary to prevent hazardous propeller effects, these maintenance actions and intervals must be published in the instructions for continued airworthiness required under CASR Part 35 Section 35.4. Additionally, if errors in maintenance of the propeller system could lead to hazardous propeller effects, the appropriate maintenance procedures must be included in the relevant propeller manuals. (2) Verification of the satisfactory functioning of safety or other devices at pre-flight or other stated periods. The details of this satisfactory functioning must be published in the appropriate manual. (3) The provision of specific instrumentation not otherwise required.

(g) Unless otherwise approved by the DGCA and stated in the safety analysis, the following failure definitions apply to compliance with this part. (1) The following are regarded as hazardous propeller effects: (i) The development of excessive drag. (ii) A significant thrust in the opposite direction to that commanded by the pilot. (iii) The release of the propeller or any major portion of the propeller. (iv) A failure that results in excessive unbalance. (2) The following are regarded as major propeller effects for variable pitch propellers: (i) An inability to feather the propeller for feathering propellers. (ii) An inability to change propeller pitch when commanded. (iii) A significant uncommanded change in pitch. (iv) A significant uncontrollable torque or speed fluctuation. 35.16 Propeller Critical Parts The integrity of each propeller critical part identified by the safety analysis required by CASR Part 35 Sec 35.15 must be established by: (a)",

(2) Failures or malfunctions directly affecting the propeller control system in a typical airplane, such as structural failures of attachments to the control, fire, or overheat, do not lead to a hazardous propeller effect. (3) The loss of normal propeller pitch control does not cause a hazardous propeller effect under the intended operating conditions. (4) (The failure or corruption of data or signals shared across propellers does not cause a hazardous propeller effect.
