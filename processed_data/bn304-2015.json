(2)Emissions from the deriva tive engines are determined to be similar. In general, this means the emissions must meet the criteria specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The DGCA may amend the criteria of paragraph (b) in unusual circumstances, for individual cases, consistent w ith good engineering judgment. (3)All of the regulated emissions from the derivative engine are lower than the original engine. (b)Emissions similarity. (1)The type certificate holder must demonstrate that the proposed derivative engine model's emissions meet the a pplicable standards and differ from the original model's emission rates only within the following ranges: (i)± 3.0 g/kN for NOX (ii)± 1.0 g/kN for HC.

If the characteristic levels of the originally certificated engine model (and all other sub -models within the emission type certificate family tested for certification) are below 95% of the applicable standard for each pollutant, the applicant may use engineering analysis consistent with good engineering judgment to demonstrate that the derivative engine will not exceed the applicable emission standards.
