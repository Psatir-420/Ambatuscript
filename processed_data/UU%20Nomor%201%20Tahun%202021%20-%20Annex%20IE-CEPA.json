If a product specific rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular materi al, the condition does not prevent the use o f other materials in addition. 6. If a product specific rule excludes materials classified in certain chapters, headings, or sub -headings of the Harmonized System, those materials must be originating for the pro ducts to qualify as originating. 7.
