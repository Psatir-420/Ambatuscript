(7) Maximum normal operating RPM means the highest rotor s peed corresponding to the airworthiness limit imposed by the manufacturer and approved by the DGCA. Where a tolerance on the highest rotor speed is specified, the maximum normal operating rotor speed is the highest rotor speed for which that tolerance is g iven. If the rotor speed is automatically linked with flight condition, the maximum normal operating rotor speed corresponding with that flight condition must be used during the noise certification procedure. If rotor speed can be changed by pilot action, the highest normal operating rotor speed specified in the flight manual limitation section for power -on conditions must be used during the noise certification procedure. www.peraturan.go.id 2017, No.1094 -10- (i) For the purpose of showing compliance with this part for tiltrotors, the follow ing terms have the specified meanings: Airplane mode means a configuration with nacelles on the down stops (axis aligned horizontally) and rotor speed set to cruise revolutions per minute (RPM). Airplane mode RPM means the lower range of rotor rotational s peed in RPM defined for the airplane mode cruise flight condition. Fixed operation points mean designated nacelle angle positions selected for airworthiness reference. These are default positions used to refer to normal nacelle positioning operation of the aircraft. The nacelle angle is controlled by a self -centering switch. When the nacelle angle is 0 degrees (airplane mode) and the pilot moves the nacelle switch upwards, the nacelles are programmed to automatically turn to the first default position (for example, 60 degrees) where they will stop. A second upward move of the switch will tilt the nacelle to the second default position (for example, 75 degrees). Above the last default position, the nacelle angle can be set to any angle up to approximately 95 degrees by moving the switch in the up or down direction. The number and position of the fixed operation points may vary on different tiltrotor configurations. Nacelle angle is defined as the angle between the rotor shaft centerline and the longitudinal axis of the aircraft fuselage. Tiltrotor means a class of aircraft capable of vertical take -off and landing, within the powered -lift category, with rotors mounted at or near the wing tips that vary in pitch from www.peraturan.go.id 2017, No.1094 -11- near vertical to near horizontal configuratio n relative to the wing and fuselage. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) mode means the aircraft state or configuration having the rotors orientated with the axis of rotation in a vertical manner ( i.e. , nacelle angle of approximately 90 degrees) for vert ical takeoff and landing operations. VCON is defined as the maximum authorized speed for any nacelle angle in VTOL/Conversion mode. VTOL/Conversion mode is all approved nacelle positions where the design operating rotor speed is used for",
