UMUM Pada tahun 1967 Perserikatan Bangsa -Bangsa telah mengeluarkan Deklarasi mengenai Penghapusan Diskriminasi terhadap wanita. Deklarasi tersebut memuat hak dan kewajiban wanita berdasarkan persamaan hak dengan pria dan menyatakan agar diambil langkah -langkah seperlunya untuk menjamin pelaksanaan Deklarasi tersebut. Oleh karena Deklarasi itu sifatnya tidak mengikat maka Komisi Perserikatan Bangsa - Bangsa tentang Ke dudukan Wanita berdasarkan Deklarasi tersebut menyusun rancangan Konvensi tentang Penghapusan Segala Bentuk Diskriminasi terhadap Wanita. Pada tanggal 18 Desember Tahun 1979 Majelis Umum Perserikatan Bangsa -Bangsa telah menyetujui Konvensi tersebut. Karena ketentuan Konvensi pada dasarnya tidak bertentangan dengan Pancasila dan Undang -Undang Dasar 1945, maka Pemerintah Republik Indonesia dalam Konferensi Sedunia Dasawarsa Perserikatan Bangsa -Bangsa bagi Wanita di Kopenhagen pada tanggal 29 Juli 1980 telah m enandatangani Konvensi tersebut. Penandatanganan itu merupakan penegasan sikap Indonesia yang dinyatakan pada tanggal 18 Desember 1979 pada waktu Majelis Umum Perserikatan Bangsa -Bangsa melakukan pemungutan suara atas resolusi yang kemudian menyetujui Konv ensi tersebut. Dalam pemungutan suara itu Indonesia memberikan suara setuju sebagai perwujudan keinginan Indonesia untuk berpartisipasi dalam usaha -usaha internasional menghapus segala bentuk diskriminasi terhadap wanita karena isi Konvensi itu sesuai deng an dasar negara Pancasila dan Undang -Undang Dasar 1945 yang menetapkan bahwa segala warga negara bersamaan k edudukannya di dalam hukum dan pemeri ntahan.
