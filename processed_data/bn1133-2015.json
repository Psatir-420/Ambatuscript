Aircraft Flight Training (1)No air carrier shall assign a person to act as a flight c rewmember unless that person has successfully completed the aircraft type flight training prescribed by this Section. Where approved by the Director, such training may be provided in: (a)an aircraft type flight simulator; (b)an aircraft; (c)and in part, a syn thetic training device (STD); or (d)a combination of an aircraft type flight simulator, STD and an aircraft. (2)The Director may give certain flight training/checking credits to synthetic training devices where he is of the opinion that such device is: (a)a true mock -up of the actual aircraft and is accurate in layout, equipment and design; (b)sufficiently functional to physically position switches and controls to their appropriate position; and (c)is used only to prepare a trainee flight crewmember: i.for the fir st motion session of the aircraft or aircraft type flight simulator; or ii.the aural portion of a proficiency or competency check. (3)Initial and recurrent flight training for pilots must include the standard operating procedures for normal, abnormal, and emergency operation of the aircraft systems and components as appropriate to crew position and duties. In providing practice in the manoeuvres and procedures as specified herein, the flight training program must include any additional manoeuvres required to satisfy the carrier’s programs for: www.peraturan.go.id 2015 , No.113334 (a)low level windshear; (b)ETOPS (c)CAT II/III; or (d)other special operations, for which the authority requires additional training. Recurrent flight training shall be conducted every 12 months and be in sufficient depth t o provide an adequate review of all the subjects contained in this section. (4)Where the manoeuvres and procedures required by paragraph (3) above, are to be accomplished in an aircraft, they shall include as appropriate to the aircraft type and trainee pil ot and, consistent with safety; (a)all pre -flight activity as laid down in the COM and appropriate to flight training; (b)use of aircraft checklist system, including interior and exterior checks; (c)taxiing; (d)aspects of flight and cabin crew co -operation, inc luding briefing, and coordination of duties; (e)take-off, approach and landings including: i.normal, full stop and touch and go; ii.rejected from not more than 60 knots on take -off, or less than 100 feet on approach to land; iii.simulated abnormal flap and fli ght control conditions; iv.landing with the critical engine in a simulated failed condition; and v.in the case of a single engine aircraft, no power forced landing. (f)normal manoeuvres during climb, descent and level flight at low and high altitudes; (g)approa ches to a stall and recovery procedures, simulating ground contact imminent and ground contact not a factor, in the clean, take -off and landing configuration; (h)steep",
